# RESTfull_API_With_Node.js_From_Scratch

This project builds a RESTfull API with Node.js on one's local machine (I chose port 4000 but you can choose a different)
In the project I implemented the following API endpoints/methods: GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE.
The project was entirely written in ES6 syntax and for this purpose I installed Babel. I also used MongoDB to persist data into the server.
I used Postman to help testing the API endpoints.

## Usage
In order to use this repository, you can fork and/or clone it to your local machine.
Before you run it, make sure you have babel installed, and that the MongoDB has been started as well.
I used Studio 3T to visualize data but feel free to use any other you'd preffer.
